Having spent a lot of time repeating the same advice in various locations I finally decided it was about time that I made myself a nice simple blog. This is intended to be a place to store my hacking notes, HackTheBox writeups and just general thoughts.

I can normally be found in a few different discord servers but the main one is the HackTheBox discord, where I am one of the Community Administrators. If there is any feedback about the blog or suggestions feel free to get hold of me on there! This is very much an ongoing project and will change as I have better ideas.
